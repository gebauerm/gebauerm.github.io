I am a Data Science researcher from Berlin. I originally studied business with 
a strong focus on risk management and statistics. During my work as a Data Scientist 
I collected knowledge about software development and neural networks as well as natural language processing (NLP). 
I was also able to publish some research papers as a co-author and will be starting my phd soon. 
Unfortunately working in business projects doesnt give the desired depth in methodology 
I am surging for, therefore I try to push myself to 
learn more about mathmatics, statistics and related data science concepts.
This blog serves as a personal archive aswell as a self-marketing page.
